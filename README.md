# This is Path.
An open-source platform for learning to code on Twitch and YouTube

We curate the content from video platforms to provide a more supportive environment for learning. Some of the benefits we aim to bring to learners:

- A place with less distractions from non-related content;
- An easy way to browse through different subjects, find established or (up-and-coming) content channels;
- Clear paths for someone who is fresh and just starting or someone who has years of experience;
- The option to maintain your schedule of streams you want to catch live or videos you want to get back to later;
- A dedicated space for content creators to link their content, post updates, schedules, integrate their Twitter feed, etc;
- Potential for integration with GitHub, CodePen and other programming resources, so you can code as you watch the content;
